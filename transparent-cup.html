          <p style="font-size: 0.7em">Â© <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jaspower/">Jaspower</a></p>
          
          <p>This all originated from a <a href="http://imgur.com/N10ESfl">post in reddit's r/mildlyinteresting</a> by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jaspower/submitted/">Jaspower</a>. Looking at his cup the redditor noticed that the reflection of the saucer lined up with the saucer itself when viewed from a specific angle.</p>
          <p>
            Being interested in maths and geometry this got me thinking: <em>Is there a shape that would make this work from any angle?</em> I soon came up with an idea and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/4t1bls/transparent_cup_from_rmildlyinteresting_is_there/">posted it on the math subreddit</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This post contains a brief explanation of my idea and finally <em>includes a proof</em>.<br/>
            (Note that I tried to keep the proof simple, so the phrasing may sometimes be inexact)
          </p>
          <h2>The Conjecture</h2>
          <p>
            I soon discovered that <em>if</em> there was a cup shape with the desired property it would have to be a hyperboloid - which is some sort of "3d hyperbola".
          </p>
          <p>
            A Hyperbola has an interesting property: any ray cast from one of its focal points will be reflected in such a way that it appears to originate from the other focal point.<br>
            In the image below this means an observer (in the top right corner) looking in the direction of F<sub>2</sub> would actually always see the mirror image of F<sub>1</sub>. The reason behind this is that the tangent in any point of a hyperbola will always be the angle bisector of the two lines leading towards the focal points.
          </p>

          <p>
            As this works in 2 dimensions I hoped it would work in 3 dimensions as well and I came up with the following
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Conjecture: To fulfill the desired property the cup has to be a hyperboloid and the rim of the saucer has to be the locus of all focal points of hyperbolas on the hyperboloid's surface.
          </p>
          <p>The locus of all focal points is a circle which we will label <em>f</em>.
          <h2>Visualization</h2>
          <p>
            Does this conjecture hold up against a quick check? A visualization in Blender shows it does:
          </p>
          <img src="cup-images/cup-saucer-reflection.png" class="img-responsive">
          <p>
            Soon I also received visualizations from other people: <a href="http://codepen.io/kzf/#">codepen user kzf</a> created a great <a href="http://codepen.io/kzf/full/akYxgY/">interactive WebGL visualization</a> (doesn't work on all browsers).
          </p>
          <h2>The proof</h2>
          <p>
            Through our arguments in the 2D case we're already very close to a proof.
          </p>

          <p>
            We already know:<br>
            If we mirror the line PF<sub>1</sub> along the tangent plane T we will get the line PF<sub>2</sub>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we want to know:<br>
            If we mirror a random line PX along the tangent plane - will we get a line that hits the circle f as well?
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's imagine X moves along the cirlce f. Which shape would the connecting line PX sweep out?<br>
            The answer is: an elliptic cone (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Elliptical_Cone_Quadric.Png">image</a>) - note that I'm referring to the infinite surface, not the solid.<br>
            An elliptic cone always has two planes of symmetry. In our case, one of these planes of symmetry <em>must</em> be the tangent plane T - as T is the plane of symmetry between PF<sub>1</sub> and PF<sub>2</sub>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore we know: Mirroring the elliptic cone along T will transform it into itself.<br>
            Thus, mirroring any line on the elliptic cone will result in another line on the cone. So:
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            A ray that's directed at a point of the circle f and gets reflected will always end up hitting another point on f.
          </p>
          <p>If we reverse the direction of the ray in our minds we're able to confirm our conjecture.</p>
